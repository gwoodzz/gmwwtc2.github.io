			<h1>Reflection Page</h1>
			 <p>It has been a long journey growing myself and figuring out what I want to achieve in life. So far, I have found certain skills about myself and I want to be able to use my skills towards a career that requires the same skills I know that I have. If I donâ€™t apply my skills to my career then I do not believe I can be successful or happy with my career choice. A goal, actually my main goal, is to pick a career that makes me happy and has a good enough salary to support my future financial decisions.
        As I got older, I noticed that I am more creative than I thought. In highschool, I took a lot of advanced math and science classes because I believed that I was a more logical person. Although I am good at those types of subjects, I have learned that I have so much potential in a creative field of work. Not only have I grown my creative experience but, I have found a passion.
        My passion for creativity allows me to work harder. Whenever I begin a creative project it excites me. I love to see an idea I have blossom into something beautiful when I turn it into reality. Working on a creative project and building it piece by piece to see what it becomes is one of the most satisfying feelings for me. I almost enjoy the journey as much as I do the end result. This is one of the reasons I have switched my major to marketing.
        One thing that has stuck with me during my academic career is that innovation runs the market. A product cannot be successful if it is not innovative. When a product is innovative it is a lot easier to market because it helps make the consumer feel like they need the product. This concept is so intriguing to me because in order to create, and sell, an innovative product you must first be creative.
    Overall, I strive to use my skills, passions, and ambitions towards my career. Growing my creativity has allowed me to work towards building something innovative. It motivates me to work everyday in hopes that I will one day have something innovative that I have built. In addition, with a combination of good marketing skills, I believe that I can develop a marketing strategy to sell whatever I develop. I will utilize my past experiences to establish a better future for myself.</p>
