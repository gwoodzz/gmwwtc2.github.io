            <h1>Leadership</h1>
			 <p> Roughly five years ago, an IOS game came out on the AppStore called Brawl Stars. I have been playing it ever since the release and I started a club. Clubs in the game are a community of players that can play together and communicate with one another through club chat. Not only can members communicate through club chat but they can also use the discord server I established that is dedicated for my club. Also, the creators of the game recently updated the game so that clubs get rewards for playing with each other with a mode called club league, making clubs more important. I am the president of a club called Akatsuki and I can proudly say that my club is ranked in the top 200 clubs in the United States. Not only are we on the U.S. leaderboard, we are also the second highest rank you can be in a club league. 
	
                Overall, the biggest skill I learned while establishing a successful club was leadership and hard work. It was not easy starting a club. I had to get members to join so I would spread the word through different networking apps like Discord and Reddit. I would also add friends on the game itself and convince them to join my club. The most challenging thing I ran into was keeping members in the club. A lot of people would join then leave all the time. To fix this, I started kicking people that were inactive and I would promote active members. This gave members an incentive to stay in the club and be active. Being a leader requires strength. If you are weak then it makes it impossible for people to follow you. </p>
