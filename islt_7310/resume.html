    Experience
    I have created multiple projects that utilize my creativity. These projects come from using the adobe apps. One of my biggest projects that I have been working on is my script. Over the course of two years I have worked nearly everyday on my script. Also, I am currently working at a sales job at GameStop. This job has taught me a lot in the art of sales such as narrative, confidence, and communication. I graduated from Rock Bridge High School and I am currently enrolled as a Junior at Mizzou. I hope to gain more experience in sales and creative projects in the future.
    
    Goals
    As mentioned, I am enrolled at Mizzou but I hope to graduate from the business school with a bachelor's degree in marketing. After graduating, I want to gain more experience in sales. However, before I graduate, I want to do an internship out of the country to broaden my horizons and gain more experience. I intend on finding a job with a positive workspace and that could use me for my skills.
