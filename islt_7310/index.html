<body> <p> Hello, my name is Garrett and this is my portfolio. For this website, I want to express my experience and skills that I have grown throughout my life. Not only will I describe my past but, I will also focus on my future. My aspirations have a major influence on my motivation. I believe it is just as important to know what I am working towards as well as my past. It allows viewers to have a better understanding of the person I am as well as the person that I strive to be. Another big goal of this website is for myself. I have recently been getting back into design so I want to be able to design a functional, yet clean, website. In the future, I hope to use this website as a tool to show people I meet who I am and what I am capable of.
