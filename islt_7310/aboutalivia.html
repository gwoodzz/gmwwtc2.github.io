<h3>Let me introduce myself.</h3>
    <p>If you told past-Alivia that future-Alivia would willingly decide to go to school for Information Technology instead of English or Music or Film or quite literally anything that's not STEM-related, then past-Alivia would laugh in your face. <em>Who's laughing now?</em>
    <br><br>Hello there. I'm Alivia Pham. With a BS in Information Technology in one hand and a minor in Film Studies in the other, it's now my  turn to enter the workforce. When I was younger, I loved to exert creativity in every aspect of my life. Upon entering university, I decided to lean into the technicalities instead. Turns out, you can <em>combine</em> them both. After dabbling in a variety of aspects of IT (digital media design, coding, cyber security, etc), I'd love to pursue a career that allows me to use these freshly minted skills and put that creativity and technicality together.
    <br><br>As past-Alivia's idol used to say (Hannah Montana)...<blockquote>you get the best of both worlds!</blockquote>
    <br><b>Please feel free to reach out. (:</b></p>

<body> Wow Alivia, it is funny how much I relate to this. I am now finding out that you can use creativity on professional work, especially coding. It is very exciting to utilize creativity while working.</body>
