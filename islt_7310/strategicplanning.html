			<h1>Strategic Planning</h1>
			 <p> Another project that I have been working on more recently is photoshop. In highschool, I used to take a class that taught me how to use Adobe photoshop. I took a break from photoshop but about a month ago I decided to get back into it on my own time. Now, I have developed multiple pieces including t-shirt designs, cover art, and I have even edited pictures for my friends to post on their Instagram. It has been difficult having to try to learn everything again but, I can confidently say now that I have made a lot of progress.

                Starting a new photoshop project requires a lot of planning but also flexibility. Whenever I decide to start a project, the first thing I do is plan the subject or subjects of the project. I decide what is going to be the main subject of my image such as a famous person, myself, an anime character, etc. Sometimes, I like to plan out a combination of two subjects and it can help make a very cool final image. Often, I have to be flexible in my projects as well. If something doesn't look as good as I planned then I work around what details could I add or redo to make an image look more appealing. </p>
