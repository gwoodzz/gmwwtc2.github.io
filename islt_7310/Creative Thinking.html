			<h1>Creative Thinking</h1>
			 <p> A project that I have been working on for a lot of time now is my script. Writing and creating stories has become a passion of mine ever since I started my script. One night, during the 2020 quarantine, I was laying in my bed and I thought of a good story. After the initial thought of the story, I could not stop thinking about it. Everyday I would keep adding and building more things to the story in my head until I realized that it was time for me to actually start working on a script for the story, since I thought of it as a T.V. show. It is now 2022 and I have now written over 40 pages for my script. So far, I have only written part of the first episode. I hope to finish the first episode soon so that I can focus on building future parts of my script like the finale.

	Creating a script and working on it almost every day for two years has shown me my creative thinking. Everyday I try to think of new ideas on how to develop and build better scenes for my story. I have learned to take notes whenever I have a good idea so that I canâ€™t forget it. I often go back to my notes when writing my script to make the story flow better. One of the biggest difficulties was commitment. It is hard to work towards something purely on my own free time and stay committed enough to see it through. What I do now is try to write at least one sentence every day so that I am at least doing something because usually after writing one sentence I have to write more. This experience has also shown that I can be committed to working towards a goal. A good thing about a script is that I only need my laptop or desktop making it very convenient to write. Lastly, if I had to do anything differently I would write to make my notes more clear. Some of my notes are difficult to understand so, going forward, I am going to make them easier to understand. </p>
