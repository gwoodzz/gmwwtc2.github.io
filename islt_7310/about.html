			<h1>About Page</h1>
			 <p>Currently, I am enrolled at Mizzou and I am going into my <em> junior year </em>. I have decided that I am going to pursue marketing as my major which is part of the business program. The field I want to specialize is in sales but my end goal is to use it for a potential online business through Shopify. Recently, I just got my first sales job at GameStop and I have enjoyed it a lot so far. Also, My dad has been the top salesman at his job for multiple years so I hope to learn from him in the future. The estimated year I plan on graduating is 2024, since I graduated high school in 2020. As mentioned, I graduated form high school which I learned a lot of my current skills from. I went to Rock Bridge High School and I was a part of the National Honors Society. Being a part of the National Honors Society was a lot of hard work but it taught me to value hard work. I now believe hard work is essential for success.</p>
